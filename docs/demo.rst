    *running Invenio 1.1.2, released 2013-08-19*

    Atlantis Institute of Fictive Science is an official demo site of
    Invenio.  It demonstrates a basic setup of Invenio. You could
    (should) obtain this site if you install Invenio for the first
    time, by lauching `inveniocfg --create-demo-site` and
    `inveniocfg --load-demo-records`. This is useful to verify the
    functionality of your installation prior to customizing the system
    for production.
