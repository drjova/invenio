Introducing Invenio for Developers
==================================

This page summarizes adoption of frameworks in used Invenio. It describes
extensions and module anatomy and concept of pluggable components across
modules.

Before you start reading please

- *Convention over Configuration* means that common building blocks
  are provided for you, so use them! If you are not sure or you are
  missing documentation about a feature you can't find as developers
  at mailing list or IRC.

- *Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)* to help us keep our software maintainable.
  Duplication of code fragments makes application codebase larger and
  more importantly it can be source of many errors during future
  development (refactoring).

- *Agile Development* where each iteration should lead to working code
  in relatively short time while incremental step are small and easy to
  understand by other developers. When you start with development take
  advantage of built-in tools provided by Python and undelying libraries::

    # Install package in editable mode
    $ pip install -e git+http://invenio-software.org/repo/invenio.git
    # Follow the instructions in src/invenio/INSTALL file.
    $ inveniomanage runserver &
    # Edit a file
    $ `$EDITOR` src/invenio/invenio/<module>/<file>.py
    # See that your server has been reloaded automatically.

  When you are done with editing do not forget to run our tests to make
  sure that all other modules are working fine (`python setup.py test`).

Extensions
----------

There are many of Flask extensions that can extend the functionality of
your application in various different ways. For instance they add support
for databases, user authentication & authorization, menu & breadcrumbs and
other common tasks.

Many of Flask extensions can be found in the `Flask Extension Registry`_.
All extensions are automatically loaded from ``EXTENSIONS`` configuration
option list. If they should a function ``setup_app(app)`` or function
accepting ``app`` needs to be specified (e.g. ``foo.bar:init``,
``mymodule:setup``).

Modules
-------

Modules are application components that can be use within an application
or across aplications.  They can contains `SQLAlchemy`_ models, `Flask`_
views, `Jinja2`_ templates and other ref:`pluggable-objects`.

Discovery of modules is done based on configuration parameter called
``PACKAGES``, where expansion character `*` is supported at the end of
package path after last dot (e.g. ``foo.bar.something.*``).
