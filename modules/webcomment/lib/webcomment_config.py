# that is the first element of the tuple in that dictionary key's value. If
# that is the case, then the dealine is retrieved as the first value of the
# MARC field that is the second element of the tuple in that dictionary key's
# value. In order to programmatically check if the deadline has passed or not
# we need to know the format of the given deadline, using standard strftime
# conversion specifications <http://linux.die.net/man/3/strftime>. The deadline
# format is the third element of the tuple in that dictionary key's value.
